# Google-Search-Analysis-with-Python
Google handles over billions of searches every day and trillions of searches each year. This shows how important it is to understand what people are searching for and in this article, weâ€™ll learn how to use Python to analyze Google search data focusing on search queries.

Output Files
After running the script, you'll get these output files:

interest_over_time.csv - Historical interest data
interest_by_region.csv - Regional interest distribution
interest_by_region.png - Visualization of regional interest
top_related_queries.csv - Top related search queries
rising_related_queries.csv - Rising related queries
keyword_suggestions.csv - Suggested keywords

Important Notes
Google Trends has rate limits (you may encounter 429 errors if making too many requests)
Results are based on relative search volume (0-100 scale)
Data may be limited for less popular search terms
Add delays between requests to avoid being blocked

Disclaimer
This project uses the unofficial Pytrends API. It may stop working if Google changes their Trends service or implements stricter rate limiting.
